# An Exercise in pulling and integrating an API

I created this project for myself to get more experience in integrating an API and wiring it up.  I knew I wanted to get more practice using API's other than following a tutorial, so I picked an API I thought might be interesting that had data I could use and went with it.  Adding a Carousel and learning SCSS were the extras that made it fun and difficult.  Adding on to that, tweaking the media formating for mobile devices was also a challenge.  In the end I learned a lot and had fun and while I had many other ideas and plans that popped up while doing this, but you have to remind yourself not to stray too far from the path/goal.  I have posted those further tweaks in my github, but I think this project as-is was enough for now being just a NYT Bestseller display vehicle.  I guess the story of this project is: "If I had the time I would one day read all the books on the NYT Bestsellers List."  It's an elusive goal as the list changes every week, just as software and technology never stands still.
