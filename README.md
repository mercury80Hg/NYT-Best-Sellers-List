#An Exercise in pulling and integrating an API

I created this project for myself to get more experience in integrating an API and wiring it up.  I knew I wanted to get more practice using API's other than following a tutorial, so I picked an API I thought might be interesting that had data I could use and went with it.  Adding a Carousel and learning SCSS were the extras that made it fun and difficult.  Adding on to that, tweaking the media formating for mobile devices was also a challenge.  In the end I learned a lot and had fun and while I had many other ideas and plans that popped up while doing this, but you have to remind yourself not to stray too far from the path/goal.  I have posted those further tweaks in my github, but I think this project as-is was enough for now being just a NYT Bestseller display vehicle.  I guess the story of this project is: "If I had the time I would one day read all the books on the NYT Bestsellers List."  It's an elusive goal as the list changes every week, just as software and technology never stands still.







# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
